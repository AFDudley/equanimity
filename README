virtualenv -p /usr/bin/python venv
source venv/bin/activate

## Running the application server

source venv/bin/activate
./run.py

## Running the tests
source venv/bin/activate
./setup.py test [--nose-only] [--run-failed]

--nose-only indicates to run only the nose test runner, and not the pep8 and pyflakes checkers
--run-failed passes this option to nose, which will only re-run failed tests
