Change "Value" to "Weight"
Change the EFIW convention to EFWI, so that there is consistent meaning to left and right orthogonals.
Verify that full games are completely deterministic.
Fix harvesting/feeding/sowing:
    All Fields Harvest
    Strongholds feed all units
    Player controlled fields sow 
    World controlled fields feed nescients based on yielded stones not in silo.

Create fourth state for world controlled fields.
    How do Nescients move out of fields?
    create the equivalent of battle.py for the new state. (this is effectively a third game, a simulated life game.)


fix line 175 in equanimity/field.py
